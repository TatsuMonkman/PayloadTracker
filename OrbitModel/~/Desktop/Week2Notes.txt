Questions for Lorcan:

  1. Questions about technical information? (Uncertainty in satellite attitude, geometric distortions, Satellite attitude/position file format TLE)
      On the ground 130m CE confidency for attitude
      Measured from
      Each pixel 0.44
      pixel pitch 5.5 microns
      500-450 km
      Attitude measured in ADCS frame

  2. Imaging procedure
  3. What info to send to operations, how to schedule imaging ops
      Worry about that after you have suite of scripts developed
  4. Sending everything to Ian's Calibration tool?
  5. How to analyze image? Image processing necessary? Can we run through this really fast?
  6. Satellite attitude quanternion units? info? I assumed measured from zenith?
  7. What happened to Planet Labs?
      Bad business planning sorry NASA
  8. How fast can I slew? How much time do I have? Am I taking a video or individual pictures?
      Degree pre second for slew
      Send attitude to mission planning in terms of inertial reference frame

  9. Velocity?
  10. Anything I should know for analytics meeting later?
  11.

  Software environment setup (Do I need ?)

  Ian's focus measurement tool: in jira tasks there is info on telescope info to generate simulated imagery (hot swap stars for moon)

  Keep mission as simple as possible until
  Satellites use TLE files
  Ian for image scheduling
  Confluence for software best practices
  Develop a suite of scripts

Questions for Ian:

  1. For lunar disks that intersect with the edges of our image - using solid angle ok?
  2. Adding my scripts into calibration routine? I need: initialization, a way to insert lunar obs into schedule



Notes:
To Do Wed/Thurs/Fri:

  1. Finish up observation window predictor
      Wednesday
      Using TLE files
      Using PyEphem
      Need to find lunar phase Calculator. found it http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Czesla/PyA/PyA/pyaslDoc/aslDoc/moon.html
      Thursday
      Work out window scheme
      do heatmap when you have time
      Begin building final scripts

  2. Build pointing instructions
      Thursday
      Easier than I thought, just need to send attitude requests (from inertial reference frame - Lorcan)
  3. Start ROLO implementation
  4. Start
